# Conway's Game of Life

This project implements Conway's Game of Life, which is a mathematical game. For more information about the game see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>

## Details
  - This implementation is made in Javascript with the use of Jquery in some places.
  - For now there is only 1 configuration from which the whole game evolves towards its final state. Later on I plan to add a UI in which you can set what kind of basic shapes and forms you want to start with, also the speed of evolution as well
